## 💡 Key Business Insights

### 1. Revenue Concentration (Pareto Principle)
*   **Insight:** Significant imbalance in performance. The **Top 4 stores contribute 86%** of total revenue, while the Bottom 4 contribute only 14%.
*   **Action:** Recommended a resource reallocation strategy to focus on high-performing branches and close underperforming ones (e.g., Daning & Longyang stores).

### 2. Cost Structure Analysis
*   **Insight:** Discovered a high subsidy rate of **52.4%**, significantly impacting net profit margins.
*   **Action:** Proposed shifting budget from direct subsidies to organic traffic growth initiatives to improve the Net Revenue Rate (currently at 36%).

### 3. Traffic & Conversion Trends
*   **Insight:** While the "Visit-to-Order" conversion rate stabilized at ~7% post-pandemic, overall store exposure showed a declining trend.
*   **Action:** Suggested revitalizing CPC advertising to drive top-of-funnel traffic, as organic traffic alone proved insufficient for scaling.
